# TigerPaw-RemoveRep
Powershell Functions to pull stale reps and remove them from TigerPaw database

Use Get-StaleTPReps to select users to add to an array

Use Remove-TPRep to loop through your selection and remove from TP database

The PSObjects that represent the Database query strings were translated into PowerShell from a SQL Statement given by TP Support

I was discouraged by Support from sharing this on the TP forums.. 

Use at your own risk, the Remove-TPRep function performs updates and deletes on the database

Read the get-help for the functions
